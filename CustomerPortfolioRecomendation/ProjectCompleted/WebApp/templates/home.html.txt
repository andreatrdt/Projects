        <h3>ETF Life - type: Accumulation</h3>
        <p>This portfolio offers a balanced mix of stocks and bonds by allocating 80% to global equities and 20% to global
            fixed income. In practice, it tracks a combined benchmark of 80% MSCI ACWI (global stock index) and
            20% Bloomberg Global Aggregate (global bond index). The high equity portion provides growth potential,
            while the bond portion adds stability and reduces overall volatility. The strategy is passive, aiming to match
            the performance of this 80/20 blended index with minimal deviation. It uses synthetic replication to achieve
            exposure to both components: the fund uses futures and similar instruments to mirror the returns of the
            equity and bond indices without holding all underlying assets directly. The Total Expense Ratio (TER) is
            fixed at 0.15% per year. Investors should have a medium to long-term horizon to benefit from the growth
            potential of this balanced portfolio while riding out short-term market fluctuations.<p>
            <p>Suitable for investors who want a one-stop portfolio combining growth and stability, with moderate risk.</p>
        <p>TER: 0.15%</p>

        <h3>ETF Bond - type: Accumulation/Income</h3>
        <p>This portfolio provides exposure to the global bond market by tracking the Bloomberg Global Aggregate
            Bond Index (ticker: LEGATRUU). The index represents a wide range of investment-grade bonds from around
            the world, including government and corporate bonds across various countries and currencies. The portfolio
            is highly diversified in fixed income and is designed to provide steady income and preserve capital with lower
            volatility. It follows a passive strategy that aims to match the index’s performance (low tracking error)
            rather than trying to outperform it. It uses synthetic replication, meaning it relies on financial derivatives
            to mirror the bond index returns without purchasing every bond in the index. The Total Expense Ratio
            (TER) is 0.13% per year. With its conservative profile, a medium-term investment horizon is suggested for
            this portfolio.<p>
            <p>Suitable for investors who prioritize capital preservation and stable income with minimal risk.</p>
        <p>TER: 0.10%</p>

        <h3>ETF Equity - type: Accumulation/Income</h3>
        <p>This portfolio tracks the MSCI ACWI Index (MXWO), a broad global stock market index that includes
            companies across developed markets. It offers high diversification by investing in thousands of stocks world-
            wide, providing investors exposure to many countries and industries for potential growth. The fund follows a
            passive strategy, aiming to closely match the index performance with minimal deviation (low tracking error)
            rather than trying to outperform it. It uses synthetic replication, meaning the portfolio employs financial
            contracts (such as futures) to mirror the returns of the MSCI ACWI without holding all the underlying
            stocks directly. The Total Expense Ratio (TER) is fixed at 0.12% per year. Given the volatility of equities,
            a long-term investment horizon is recommended to weather market ups and downs.<p>
            <p>Suitable for investors who want broad global stock market exposure and can tolerate moderate risk for
            long-term growth.</p>

        <h3>Alternative Bond - type: Income</h3>
        <p>Alternative Bond offers global fixed-income exposure with active management to enhance returns or manage
            risk. Instead of strictly following a benchmark, the portfolio can shift its mix of government and corporate
            bonds to seize opportunities or guard against changing market conditions. It uses synthetic replication to
            mirror the bond market index, while active tweaks aim to boost yield or lessen volatility. The objective
            is active: rather than just tracking an index, it strives to beat it or avoid losses when bond markets are
            under pressure. This strategy may incur a slightly higher TER of 1% due to the hands-on management.
            Risk remains relatively low (mostly high-quality bonds), but the portfolio can take on a bit more risk than
            a passive bond fund in pursuit of higher returns.<p>
            <p>Suitable for investors seeking steady income with a potential performance edge, who are comfortable with
            an active bond approach for the medium term.</p>

        <h3>Alternative Equity - type: Income</h3>
        <p>Alternative Equity invests in global stocks with an active strategy aimed at boosting returns or reducing
            downside risk. This is an actively managed equity portfolio investing globally, with the MSCI ACWI Index
            (MXWO) serving as its benchmark.Unlike a passive index fund, this portfolio can make tactical adjustments
            to try to outperform the market or limit losses in downturns. It still uses synthetic replication for core index
            exposure, but adds active tweaks for a smoother ride. The objective is active: rather than just track an
            index, it aims for better risk-adjusted returns (e.g. smaller losses in down markets). This strategy comes
            with a slightly higher TER of 1.2% due to the added management. Because active equity investing can lead
            to higher volatility, a long-term investment horizon is recommended to allow the strategy to play out and to
            weather short-term market swings.<p>
            <p>Suitable for investors who seek to beat the global equity market and are willing to accept higher risk through
            active management and have a long-term view.</p>
        <p>TER: 1.2%</p>

        <h3>Alternative Life - type: Accumulation</h3>
        <p>Alternative LifeStrategy 80/20 is a balanced portfolio (80% stocks, 20% bonds) managed dynamically instead
            of following a fixed allocation. It remains globally diversified but actively manages stress market conditions.
            Using synthetic replication for core exposures, the manager can tactically shift the balance to seize opportu-
            nities or reduce risk. The goal is to improve the risk-return profile over a static 80/20, for example, trimming
            stocks in a downturn or increasing them in a rally. This flexibility comes with a slightly higher TER of 1.5%
            due to active oversight. With its moderated risk level and active oversight, a long-term investment perspec-
            tive is recommended so that the portfolio’s adjustments have time to add value and weather different market
            conditions.<p>
            <p>Suitable for investors who want a balanced long-term plan with tactical risk management and are willing to
            pay a bit more for potential downside protection.</p>
        <p>TER: 1.5%</p>
        <p>Risk: 3/7</p>
